Scientific Calculator
Hello everyone! Khabi in touch!
I tried to recreate exactly the calculator built into Samsung phones. 
For the appearance of additional functions, such as sine, cosine, etc., you must click on the "Calculator" icon, located on the same line as "Backspace".
At the moment, three buttons do not work: "History", "Convert", "Switch".
